NeoFlat Component Set is a faithful remake of the visual style introduced by the FlatStyle Component Pack. Its purpose is to accurately recreate the distinctive flat user interface aesthetic characteristic of 2000s Windows applications while fully modernizing it for contemporary Delphi environments. The original FlatStyle Component Pack was widely adopted by Delphi developers throughout the 2000s, becoming a reference for flat-style user interface design in that era.

While the appearance closely follows the original design, the vast majority of the codebase has been completely re-written / re-engineered from scratch for modern Delphi versions. This is not a simple port.

In rare cases (e.g. TFlatComboBox), limited portions of code may be directly inherited from the original FlatStyle components. Where such code remains, it is subject to the original license terms of those components, and full credit belongs to the original author, Lloyd Kinsella. For those specific portions, the original licensing conditions apply unchanged.
