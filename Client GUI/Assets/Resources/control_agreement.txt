If you do not fully understand English, you must not continue. Make sure you clearly understand every part of the information below before authorizing remote access.

Allowing remote control gives another party the ability to view your screen, access your files, and perform actions on your computer. This includes installing or removing software, viewing personal documents, modifying system settings, and accessing sensitive information. Once access is granted, you may not be able to prevent unwanted actions.

You should never authorize remote access when contacted unexpectedly or by someone you do not fully trust. Be extremely cautious in situations such as the following:

- Unsolicited phone calls claiming to be from technical support, a bank, an insurance company, or a government agency. Legitimate organizations do not call you to request remote control of your computer.
- People telling you that your computer has a virus or security problem and insisting that you must install special software to fix it. This is a common tactic used to gain control of your system.
- Messages or pop-ups warning that your computer is infected and urging you to call a number or download a tool immediately. These alerts are often fraudulent.
- Individuals asking for remote access to confirm a payment, unlock an account, process a refund, or verify your identity. Reputable institutions will never require remote control for these tasks.
- Anyone pressuring you to act quickly, creating a sense of urgency, or telling you that your data will be lost if you do not comply. Scammers often rely on stress and confusion to obtain access.

If you proceed, do so only with a person or organization you know, trust completely, and have contacted yourself using verified information. Never allow remote access based on fear, pressure, or unexpected contact.

If you have any doubt, even a small one, you should stop immediately.
